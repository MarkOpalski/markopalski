## Hi, I'm Mark
Here's some stuff I built (most of it works on my machine).

## Unordered list of said stuff

### [Web Font Specimen](https://github.com/MarkOpalski/font-specimen) 
**[Live Demo](https://markopalski.github.io/font-specimen/)**

Enhanced version of Tim Brown's systematic font testing tool. Vite + CSS Grid + Google Fonts + WCAG compliance.

### [Retro Future Security Station](https://guardian-ai-monitor.netlify.app/)
NUI for highly experienced Sys Admins and SOC operators.

### [Baseball Seat Finder](https://imaginative-bublanina-75efd1.netlify.app/)
So I can catch a Shohei homerun someday.

### [Comic Book Collector App](https://comic-library-applic-my36.bolt.host/)
Fans like collecting and owning their comics. I'd like software worthy of that—software fans own that won't get torpedoed by a big corporation.

### [Kitty vs Birdy](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/945045567/)
My first game.
