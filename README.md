Hi, Iâ€™m Mark ðŸ‘‹

I'm still getting my legs here on GitHub and building up my contributions. In the meantime... here's a little about me. 

Design systems thinker who creates tools for both users and fellow creators. Code + design + documentation = my happy place.

_Problem Types I Gravitate Toward_

- Making complex systems **understandable and operable**  
- Helping newer designers navigate complexity and ambiguity  
- Exploring how creative and scientific processes can reinforce each other
