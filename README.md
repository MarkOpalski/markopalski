## Hi, I'm Mark Opalski

I experiment with user interfaces and interactive experiences, exploring all the various ways to code with AI—from code-copilots and vibe-coding to in-browser tools, native clients, and design platforms.

Currently fascinated by the weird, wonderful space where human creativity meets machine intelligence. Some days I'm building with AI, other days I'm building *for* AI interactions, and most days I'm trying to figure out which is which.

## AI Experiments

Explore my collection of AI-driven projects and experiments: 

These projects showcase creative uses of AI in design, security, productivity, and sports:
- **Retro Future Security Station UI**: A conceptual user interface blending retro aesthetics with modern security workflows
- **[A Notes App](https://markopalski.github.io/prompt-playground/projects/todo-app/)**: An intelligent notes application focused on simplicity and smart organization  
- **A Home Run Tracker**: A tool for tracking and visualizing baseball home runs with AI-powered insights

*More experiments brewing—some work, some don't, all teach me something.*

## What I Focus On

- Turning complex systems into intuitive, operable experiences
- Finding the sweet spot between AI capability and human agency
- Building interfaces that feel natural even when the underlying tech is anything but

## The Obligatory Portfolio

[markopalski.com](https://www.markopalski.com/) — A visual record of project work presented in an antiquated model known as the 'portfolio'. The term was carried over from the days of print design and desktop publishing. I believe the portfolio is an extinct model, but I'm required to have one, so I reluctantly made it.

*(It's actually not terrible, despite my protests.)*

## Currently

Working on understanding how we design for a world where the line between human and AI contribution keeps shifting. Also trying to perfect my coffee-to-code ratio.
