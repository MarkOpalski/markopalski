# Hello, I'm Mark Opalski, a Designer Making Things in New York ⭐️

## 🧑‍💻 What Makes Me Tick  
I live for those moments when design solves real problems that people actually have. Give me a thorny user challenge over a decorative mockup any day.

## 🤖 Why I'm Here on Git  
I thrive in the creative chaos of collaboration. Put me in a room with makers, builders, and curious minds, and I'm at my best. The open-source community's collaborative spirit is what drew me here.
