## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome  
Abandon expectations, all ye who enter here.

## Briefly

#### _A bit about me_

I'm proud to be someone who creates tools for people and fellow creators. Creating things people interact with and use and hopefully enjoy = my happy place.

#### _Problems I gravitate toward_

- Converting complex systems into **understandable and operable** experiences 
- Helping newer designers navigate the complexity and ambiguity of this industry  
- Exploring how creative and scientific processes can reinforce each other  


#### _Repos I'm tinkering with_

- **[ux-portfolio](https://github.com/MarkOpalski/ux-portfolio)** â€” the live code for the one-page dark-theme site (Astro + TS) 
- **[netlify-feature-tour](https://github.com/MarkOpalski/netlify-feature-tour)** â€” proof-of-concept for an in-app onboarding tour
- **[startup-design-hiring-kit](https://github.com/MarkOpalski/startup-design-hiring-kit)** â€” ready-to-use scorecards & briefs for first UX hires 


##### _Find me elsewhere_
