## Hi, I'm Mark Opalski

I experiment with user interfaces and interactive experiences, exploring all the various ways to code with AI—from code-copilots and vibe-coding to in-browser tools, native clients, and design platforms.

Currently fascinated by the weird, wonderful space where human creativity meets machine intelligence. Some days I'm building with AI, other days I'm building *for* AI interactions, and most days I'm trying to figure out which is which.

## Typography & Design Tools

### [Web Font Specimen](https://github.com/MarkOpalski/font-specimen) 
**[Live Demo](https://markopalski.github.io/font-specimen/)**

Enhanced version of Tim Brown's systematic font testing tool with modern web technologies:
- Vite build tooling for fast development
- HTML5 + CSS Grid modernization  
- Google Fonts integration with WCAG compliance
- Preserves original educational design methodology

*Originally by Tim Brown (Adobe), enhanced with modern web standards while maintaining the systematic approach to typography testing.*
