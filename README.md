## Hi, I’m Mark Opalski

I experiment with user interfaces and interactive experiences, exploring all the various ways to code with AI—from code-copilots and vibe-coding to in-browser tools, native clients, and design platforms.

## AI Experiments

Explore my collection of AI-driven projects and experiments, hosted on my GitHub Pages: [markopalski.github.io](https://markopalski.github.io/)

These projects showcase creative uses of AI in design, security, productivity, and sports:

- **Retro Future Security Station UI**: A conceptual user interface blending retro aesthetics with modern security workflows.
- **A Notes App**: An intelligent notes application focused on simplicity and smart organization.
- **A Home Run Tracker**: A tool for tracking and visualizing baseball home runs with AI-powered insights.

## What I Focus On
- Turning complex systems into intuitive, operable experiences
