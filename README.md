# Hello, this is Mark Opalski, a product Founder & Principal, Consulting UX ⭐️
_(Dev-Friendly Designer • Open-Source Collaborator)_

## 🧑‍💻 My Pretensions  
I'm more than a GUI designer; I'm a **dev-friendly designer**.  
That means I'm happiest working alongside engineers solving _real_ user problems—preferably the kind we've seen with our own eyes. That’s the rubber-meets-road moment.

I'm obsessed with how people actually use technology, not just whether they think it looks pretty.  
Function before form (but sure, I’ll kern headings, I'll never not love typography).

## 🤖 Why I'm on Git  
I'm here to get better with the **terminal**, **contribute to open-source projects**, and meet other slightly obsessive, problem-solving **weirdos**. Along the way, I aim to make contributions that are clear, respectful, and genuinely helpful to the projects I join.

Ever since 1995—when I first met developers trading code like zines and passionately debating the ethics of software freedom—I’ve been hooked.  
The open-source spirit blew my mind: collaborative, decentralized, and allergic to marketing.  
It felt like discovering a secret society that *actually worked*.

So yes, I’m showing up late, but I bring snacks and genuine curiosity.
And let’s be honest: AI code assistants are making it way easier for folks like me to dive in.  
_They don’t roll their eyes when I ask the same noob question 12 times, which makes them better collaborators than most humans I know._

## 🛠️ What I Love Building
- Real-world tools that people use every day
- Interfaces that make complex things feel simple
- Systems that stay maintainable long after the first deploy
