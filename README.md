# Hello, this is Mark Opalski, a GUI designer on GitHub ⭐️  
_What's the world coming to?_

## 🧑‍💻 My Pretensions  
I'm more than a GUI designer; I'm a **dev-friendly designer**.  
That means I'm happiest working alongside engineers solving _real_ user problems—preferably the kind we've seen with our own eyes. That’s the rubber-meets-road moment.

I'm obsessed with how people actually use technology, not just whether they think it looks pretty.  
Function before form (but sure, I’ll kern headings, I'll never not love typography).

## 🤖 Why I'm on Git  
I'm here to get better with the **terminal**, **contribute to open-source projects**, and meet other slightly obsessive, problem-solving **weirdos**.

Ever since 1995—when I first met developers trading code like zines and passionately debating the ethics of software freedom—I’ve been hooked.  
The open-source spirit blew my mind: collaborative, decentralized, and allergic to marketing.  
It felt like discovering a secret society that *actually worked*.

So yes, I’m showing up late, but I bring snacks and genuine curiosity.

And let’s be honest: AI code assistants are making it way easier for folks like me to dive in.  
_They don’t roll their eyes when I ask the same noob question 12 times, which makes them better collaborators than most humans I know._
