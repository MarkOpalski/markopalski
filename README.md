# Hello, this is Mark Opalski, a Designer based in New York ⭐️

## 🧑‍💻 My Pretensions  
I'm more than a GUI designer; I'm a **dev-friendly designer**.  
That means I'm happiest working alongside engineers solving _real_ user problems—preferably the kind we've seen with our own eyes. That’s the rubber-meets-road moment.

I'm obsessed with how people actually use technology, not just whether they think it looks pretty.  
Function before form (but sure, I’ll kern headings, I'll never not love typography).

## 🤖 Why I'm on Git  
I'm here to get better with the **terminal**, **contribute to open-source projects**, and meet other slightly obsessive, problem-solving **weirdos**. Along the way, I aim to make contributions that are clear, respectful, and genuinely helpful to the projects I join.

From the early days of the internet, I first met developers trading code like zines and passionately debating the ethics of software freedom—I’ve been hooked.
The open-source spirit blew my mind: collaborative, decentralized, and allergic to marketing.
It felt like discovering a secret society that *actually worked*.

And in all honesty: AI code assistants have made coding learnable for folks like me. As a beginner, I have many questions, and the best thing about AI is it's endless patience. 
_They don’t roll their eyes when I ask the same noob question 12 times, which makes them great collaborators for learning._ Something I believe will catch on and spread globally, if it hasn't already.

## 🛠️ What I Love Building
- Real-world tools that people use every day
- Interfaces that make complex things feel simple
- Systems that stay maintainable long after the first deploy
