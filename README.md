# Hello, I'm Mark Opalski, a Designer Making Things in New York City

I get excited about design that solves real problems. Give me a challenging user issue over a pretty mockup any day—I'm here for the meaningful work that makes a difference in how people experience products.

## My Approach
I mix classic design thinking with new AI tools to create work that's both human-centered and technically solid. I've always found my best ideas emerge when collaborating with smart, curious people from different backgrounds. That's why I value the open-source community—it brings together diverse perspectives united by a shared goal of building better things.

I'm particularly interested in design systems, accessibility, and finding faster ways to bring good ideas to life.

## My Current Toolbox
- **Design & Prototyping:** Figma, Framer, Bolt.new
- **AI Collaboration:** GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Alter AI, Cursor AI
- **Development:** VS Code, Storybook, Supabase, Netlify
- **Design Systems:** Tokens Studio, Radix UI, shadcn/ui
- **Collaboration:** Notion, Linear, Atlassian Suite, GitHub

## I'm Currently Exploring
- AI-assisted design workflows
- Component-driven development
- Design token implementation
- Accessible design systems at scale
