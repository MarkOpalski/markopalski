## Hi, I’m Mark Opalski

I create tools and experiences that help people work better, think clearly, and navigate complexity.  
I specialize in UX systems, AI-assisted workflows, and behaviorally informed design at enterprise scale.

### What I Focus On
- Turning complex systems into intuitive, operable experiences
- Guiding teams through ambiguity with applied behavioral science
- Using the scientific method to reinforce creative exploration
- Building high-leverage UX strategy for mission-critical domains

### Projects in Progress
- `ux-portfolio` — Dark-themed portfolio template for anyone to copy
- `netlify-feature-tour` — Lightweight in-app onboarding tour
- `startup-design-hiring-kit` — Briefs, scorecards & onboarding for early-stage UX hiring
